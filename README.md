# Mall Directory Archive Project

As one of the youngest Gen Xers (born July 1, 1979), I caught the tail end of the golden arcade era. While the arcade boom peaked from 1976 to 1984, my formative mall memories come from the mid-to-late 1980s—particularly at Northlake Mall in Tucker, Georgia, the nostalgic epicenter of my childhood. Unable to locate exact details about Northlake's layout and store directory from that era, I've turned to newspapers.com to scour archives across various states for mall directories from similar shopping centers. These small newspaper directory ads are invaluable resources: they show store layouts, relative sizes, and complete tenant lists—all in one place—enabling detailed research into what these storefronts looked like, their inventory, and interior designs.

The ultimate goal of this project is to create an accurate VRChat world that recreates these lost spaces. While I'd love to rebuild Northlake Mall circa 1987, I'd rather work from actual historical records than create a vague, inaccurate approximation. If I can find comprehensive documentation of a similar mall from that era, I'll recreate that one instead. My ideal mall must include certain quintessential stores: RadioShack for electronics, an arcade (like Aladdin's Castle or Gold Mine), a pre-Barnes & Noble bookstore (B. Dalton Bookseller, Waldenbooks), classic anchor stores (Sears, JCPenney, Macy's, Davison's/Rich's, Service Merchandise, or Dillards), and crucially, a record store like Turtles Records and Tapes or Camelot Music. This archive documents my findings as I search for the perfect mall to bring back to virtual life.

## Goals

* Collect high-quality scans or photographs of mall directories from the **1980s–1990s**, with a focus on the **late 1980s (1985–1989)**.
* Identify each mall (location, anchors, notable inline stores).
* Narrow down the **date range** of each directory using anchor stores and chain histories.
* Record the **criteria** that help confirm the approximate date.
* Use findings to choose one or more directories for a faithful reproduction project.

## Criteria for Ideal Directory (Late 1980s Nostalgia)

* **Arcade**: Must include an arcade (e.g., **Aladdin’s Castle**, **Goldmine**, etc.).
* **Music Store**: Should have a records/tapes store. Mentions of vinyl and cassette tapes are ideal; CDs are less desirable.
* **Electronics**: Must include a **Radio Shack**.
* **Bookstore**: Preferably a now-defunct mall bookstore chain like **Waldenbooks** or **B. Dalton Bookseller**.
* **Trendy/Youth Stores**: Stores like **Gadzooks** or **Spencer’s Gifts** are a plus.
* **Anchor Stores**: Ideally should include at least some of the classic big anchors of the era:

  * **Macy’s**
  * **Sears**
  * **JCPenney**
  * Regional anchors (e.g., Carson Pirie Scott, Montgomery Ward) acceptable
* **Mall Demographic**: Should feel **middle-class accessible**, not overly high-end or luxury.

## Northwoods Mall (Peoria, Illinois)

![Northwoods Mall directory](images/northwoods-mall.png)

* **Mall**: Northwoods Mall, Peoria, Illinois
* **Anchors**: Carson Pirie Scott, Montgomery Ward, JCPenney
* **Notable Stores**:

  * Aladdin’s Castle (arcade)
  * B. Dalton (bookstore)
  * Musicland (records/tapes)
  * Radio Shack (electronics)
  * Afterthoughts, The Limited, The Gap, Casual Corner, Fannie May, Sbarro, Kinney Shoes
* **Dating Evidence**:

  * **Afterthoughts** → Popular in early 1990s, merged into Claire’s \~2000
  * **Kinney Shoes** → Closed in 1998
  * **Montgomery Ward** → Still open, closed in 2001
  * **Anchors intact** and **tenant mix typical of mid-90s**
* **Estimated Date Range**: **1992–1997**
* **Notes**: Directory provides good nostalgic value, but slightly later than the target late 1980s window. If a version from \~1987–1989 can be located, it would be ideal.
